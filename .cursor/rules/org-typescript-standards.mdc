# Organization TypeScript Standards

## Core Requirement
- Use TypeScript for all new code development.

## Code Quality & Style
- **TSDoc:** Maintain comprehensive TSDoc documentation:
  - All public APIs (functions, classes, types, interfaces, variables) must have TSDoc comments.
  - All functions must document parameters (`@param`) and return values (`@returns`).
  - All types, interfaces, and classes must have descriptive comments.
  - Complex algorithms or logic must include detailed explanations within comments.
  - Provide `@example` blocks for non-obvious usage.
  - Aim for near-complete documentation coverage (e.g., target 99% if tooling allows measurement).
- **Type Safety:** Utilize TypeScript's type system effectively. Avoid `any` where possible and prefer specific types.
- **Typing:** Under no circumstances should 'any' or 'unknown' types be used
- **Async/Await:** Use `async/await` consistently for asynchronous operations. Handle errors properly using `try...catch` blocks or promise rejection handling.
- **Immutability:** Prefer immutable data structures and updates, especially when dealing with state management, to avoid side effects.

## Package Development (for Libraries/Shared Code)
- **Modularity:** Keep packages small, focused, and with clear responsibilities.
- **API Design:** Export types for all public APIs to support consumers.
- **Versioning:** Use a standard process (like changesets - see repo-specific rules) for versioning packages.
- **Change Management:** Clearly document breaking changes.
- **Compatibility:** Strive for backward compatibility when making changes.

## Component Development (Primarily for UI/React)
- **Accessibility:** Follow accessibility (a11y) best practices.
- **Error Handling:** Implement proper error boundaries and user-friendly error states.
- **Typing:** Use TypeScript strictly for props, state, and event handlers.
- **Documentation:** Document component props, usage, and purpose clearly (using TSDoc for exported components).
- **Purity:** Keep components pure (predictable output for given inputs) whenever feasible.

## State Management (Primarily for UI/React)
- **Local State:** Use standard mechanisms like React hooks (`useState`, `useReducer`) for local component state.
- **Loading/Error States:** Implement clear loading indicators and handle errors gracefully in the UI.
- **Network Requests:** Cache network requests appropriately to improve performance and reduce redundant calls.

## Performance
- **Optimization:** Be mindful of performance implications. Optimize critical code paths.
- **Bundling:** Utilize techniques like bundle analysis and code splitting to manage application size.
- **Caching:** Implement appropriate caching strategies (client-side and server-side).
- **Asset Optimization:** Optimize images, fonts, and other static assets.

## Documentation Standards
- **API Changes:** Document changes to public APIs clearly (e.g., in changelogs or PR descriptions).
- **Usage Examples:** Update usage examples when APIs change or new features are added.
- **Setup Instructions:** Ensure setup and installation instructions are clear and accurate.
- **Environment Variables:** Document necessary environment variables for setup and configuration.

## Dependency Management
- Minimize adding new external dependencies. Check if existing project dependencies or standard browser/Node.js APIs can achieve the goal first.
- If adding a new dependency is necessary, justify its inclusion and prefer well-maintained and reputable libraries.

## AI Interaction Guidelines (When using AI Assistance)
- **Language:** Generate TypeScript code.
- **Consistency:** Follow existing project patterns, conventions, and architectural choices.
- **Error Handling:** Implement consistent and robust error handling.
- **Documentation:** Ensure AI-generated code, especially complex algorithms, is well-documented.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test any code generated or modified by AI.
- **Performance:** Consider the performance implications of generated code.
- **Reuse:** Prefer using existing utilities, components, and libraries within the project.
- **Structure:** Respect the established monorepo structure and package boundaries.
- **Dependencies:** Be mindful of adding new dependencies; use existing ones where possible (see Dependency Management section).
